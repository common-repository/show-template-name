Plugin to improve the management of your page templates and Custom post Type on WordPress

== Description ==
With this plugin, you can easily see which templates have been assigned to each page in the list. It is mandatory if you have a theme with many templates and pages, with this plugin you will easily identify them.

Now you can filter by the name of the template, so easily locate pages that use the template.

We've also added the template Slug name as a class in the body of the Gutenberg editor as well as in the front of the template to better encapsulate the styles if you need it.
